# Drawing Metadata Retriever

## Author
Dane (Sara) Wright

## Description
This is a Java & Maven project.
Created with the intention of seeing what metadata I could get from my collection of digital drawings.

You'll have to enter the full path of the folder you what to search through.
EX: C:\Users\<username>\Pictures

The program will search through the specified folder and then any subfolders within.
It will output the data to a CSV file.

### Notes
PNG files are difficult to read metadata from, so this program will retrieve mostly blank rows from them.

## Known Problems, Issues, And/Or Errors in the Program
This is the first thing I've ever made in Java, so I'm sure there's something wrong with it somewhere.
